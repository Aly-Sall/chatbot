# Interactive Chatbot Using CRISP-DM and Open-Source LLM

This project implements an interactive chatbot using open-source LLM (Large Language Models) with the CRISP-DM methodology for systematic development. The chatbot leverages technologies such as Python, Ollama, and LangChain for robust and efficient natural language processing.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build an interactive chatbot using the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. CRISP-DM ensures a structured and repeatable process for developing machine learning and data mining projects.

The chatbot is designed to process user inputs and provide meaningful, context-aware responses using advanced language modeling techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for development.
- **Ollama**: For managing and running large language models locally.
- **LangChain**: Framework to simplify the integration of LLMs and enable dynamic workflows.

## Project Workflow (CRISP-DM)
### 1. Business Understanding
Define the objectives of the chatbot:
- Provide context-aware, accurate, and interactive responses.
- Seamlessly integrate with user inputs in a conversation-style interface.

### 2. Data Understanding
Understand and preprocess:
- Train and fine-tune LLMs using existing datasets.
- Prepare prompt engineering strategies to optimize interactions.

### 3. Data Preparation
Steps:
- Preprocessing text datasets.
- Tokenization and vectorization for compatibility with LLMs.

### 4. Modeling
- Use **Ollama** to manage open-source LLMs efficiently.
- Integrate **LangChain** for chaining tasks like context memory, user intent detection, and dynamic response generation.

### 5. Evaluation
- Test chatbot accuracy using evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU score, user feedback).
- Ensure it handles diverse user queries robustly.

### 6. Deployment
- Host the chatbot locally or on a cloud platform.
- Provide a simple interface for user interaction.
